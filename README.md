<h2>An AirBnB Clone</h2>

## Description

The AirBnB Console is part of the larger AirBnB project, providing a backend management interface for property owners, administrators and users. It offers a set of commands to create, retrieve, update and delete data from the AirBnB database.

The goal of this project is to deploy a replica of the <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/" style="text-decoration: none;">AirBnB Website</a> . The end product of the project will have:

<h2>The Console</h2>
<p>The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored.

This abstraction will also allow you to change the type of storage easily without updating all of your codebase.

The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine<p>
<ul>
<li>Create your data model</li>
<li>manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter</li>
<li>store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)<li>
</ul>
